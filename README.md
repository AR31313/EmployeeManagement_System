- Upon starting the application, users are presented with the options to:
  view all departments,
  view all roles,
  view all employees,
  add a role,
  add an employee,
  and update an employee role.

- Upon choosing view all departments, view all employees, view all roles:
  users are presented with a formatted table showing the information they have selected.

- Users can add a role or choose to add an employee as well.

- When users choose to update an employee role,
